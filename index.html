    <h1> Introduction</h1>
    <h2> What is realized volatility?</h2>
    <span>The realized volatility is a new rising concept in the financial literature,which is often used to measure the price variability, and could be used to measure the actual price risk in the market.</span>
    <h2> Why carry out this app?</h2>
    <span>Realized volatility is a very useful measurement to measure stock price variablity.However, the calculation process is not easy. It needs to use multiple variables. Also, since the realized volatility depends on the particular situation.If one wants to compute the measurement in different length of period, he needs to change different datasets at each time. Because of that, no financial website will provided the whole set of calculated realized volatility for readers. When users would like to look at the structure of realized volatility, they always have to calculate by themselves.
    I have imagine several scenes. Someone may want to see a stock's realized volatility in a certain day with different length, while someone wants to see a stock's realized
volatility in a certain situation in a continuous time period, someone even wants to see all the above at the same time. Someone may want to compare 2 stocks' realized volatility under the same condition. Also, someone may want to have ML technique to predict the future trend. I would like to try to meet all these requests?
That is the motivation for me to propose this project.
